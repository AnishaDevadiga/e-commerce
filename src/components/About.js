      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h4>
        An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical
        goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a
        brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can
        process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and
        provide customer service. It’s tough to imagine daily life without
        e-commerce. We order food, clothes, and furniture; we register for
        classes and other online services; we download books, music, and movies;
        and so much more. E-commerce has taken root and is here to stay. The
        term “e-commerce” simply means the sale of goods or services on the
        internet. In its most basic form, e-commerce involves electronically
        transferring funds and data between 2 or more parties. This form of
        business has evolved quite a bit since its beginnings in the electronic
        data interchange of the 1960s and the inception of online shopping in
        the 1990s.
