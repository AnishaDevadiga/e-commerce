        customers feel they’re buying from a real person. A return policy A
        return policy not only makes it easier for people to send back products
        that don’t satisfy them, it actually increases sales by lowering
        shopping cart abandonment and instilling the customer with a sense of
        confidence and trust that they can send back an item if they need to,
        without any transaction fees.
